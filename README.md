# HyperGL

[Original Author and Repository](https://github.com/szabolcsdombi/zengl)

HyperGL is an OpenGL wrapper deriving from ZenGL.

It is free-threading safe. And no dependencies. Just one pip install away!

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Evilpasture/HyperGL.git
```

HyperGL includes everything ZenGL had, with the addition of compute shading and storage buffers.
